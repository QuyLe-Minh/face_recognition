# face_recognition
Here is my small computer vision project.


Note:
- You have to install face_recognition and dlib to use. The command for Window command prompt is : 
1. pip install dlib
2. pip install face_recognition
- You have to make your own picture file then replace my path to use. You can see some instructions in my code file.
- I dont build Neural Network or using strong deep learning algorithms for this project so the accuracy is quite low (about 50-60%). I'll try to update it someday.
